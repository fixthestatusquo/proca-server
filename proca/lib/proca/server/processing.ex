  For these cases:
  1. We receive Actions with Supporter or with unbound ref.
  2. Action with supporter may have new or resolved supporter (by ref).
  3. Action with unbound ref will be bound later.

  Processing works in following way:
  1. Process supporter, then action.
  2. Process supporter.
  3. ignore. This is a case where we store action for counts (share, tweet
  without any contact, and it might never arrive). On the other hand, it would be nice to have this later in CRM right? 

  State diagram below shows transitions while processing. `A` stands for Action,
  `S` for supporter. States are enumerated in `ProcessingStatus`, and supporter
  and action track its status separately.

  ```
      [ A(NEW) / nil ]
          | linking
          v
      [ A(NEW) / S(NEW) ]            <-----.  linking new action to rejected supporter
          | emit to supporter confirm      | 
          v                                |  
      [ A(NEW) / S(CONFIRMING)] -> [ A(REJECTED) / S(REJECTED) ] --> stop (and remove the cookie?!)
          | confirm 
          v
    ,->[ A(NEW) / S(ACCEPTED)]
    |     | emit to action confirm
  n |     v
  e |  [ A(CONFIRMING) / S(ACCEPTED)] -> [ A(REJECTED) / S(ACCEPTED)] --> stop
  w |     | confirm
    |     v
    '--[ A(ACCEPTED) / S(ACCEPTED)] -> [ A(DELIVERED) / S(ACCEPTED)] --> stop
                                   emit
  ```
  This mechanism is supposed to be able to run many times with same result if
  action and supporter bits do not change.

  At the moment we do not support custom action confirmation - fully - we do not send actions to this queue and there is not routes in API to confirm or reject an action.
  This is a missing piece albeit for now did not proove necessary.
