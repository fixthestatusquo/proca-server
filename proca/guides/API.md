# Proca Server API 

Proca Server uses a [GraphQL API](https://graphql.org/) at an endpoint `/api` for a HTTP connection or `/socket` for a WebSocket connection. You will need WebSocket to run subscription operations with GraphQL, however, for Proca Server the HTTP API is usually enough (currently there is 1 subscription operation).

If you develop for node, you can use `@proca/api` library to create a configured GraphQL client (using `urql` library).

GraphQL provides a discoverable API, which you can explore in the playground at `/graphiql` endpoint ([example](https://api.proca.app/graphiql)), or using a GraphQL client of choice.


## Authentication and security context

All operations run in some user context:

- Anonymous 
- Authenticated - an User is assigned to the opration based on one of authentication methods, and optionally a current organisation - they form a security context.

### authentication methods

Use `Authorization` header to authenticate the operation. We support: 

- HTTP Basic Auth header with email + password: `Authorization: Basic base64-encoded-user:password`
- API token - generated by Proca Server for a user (create it with `resetApiToken` mutation): `Authorization: API-XXXXXXX`
- JWT token - if configured; tested with [Zero Trust Proxy](https://www.ory.sh/docs/oathkeeper/) and [GoTrue/Supabase](https://supabase.com): `Authorization: eyJWT-token-JWTJWTJWTJWTJWTJWTJWT`


### Errors

Errors are returned as a list of GraphQL errors, each consisting of a human readable `message`, `path` specifying which input value causes a problem, and `extensions` object, which has a machine readable error `code`.


## Example query with basic authenticate

Consider this TypeScript code. It creates a connection using HTTP Basic Auth using helpers from `@proca/api` library. Then it runs a query to fetch current, authenticated user. We recommend to use GraphQL Codegen to create a typed query documents from `foo.graphql` files. This will provide you with typed responses from the API and ease unpacking returned objects.

```typescript
import "cross-fetch/polyfill" // for missing fetch() in node...
import {httpLink, basicAuth} from '@proca/api'

const whoami = async (email : string, pwd : string) => {
  const client = httpLink('https://api.proca.app', basicAuth({username: email, password: pwd}));

  const query = `
    query CurrentUserOrgs {
      currentUser {
        email roles { role org {name title} }
      }
    }`
  const {data, error} = await client.query(query, {}).toPromise()

  if (error?.graphQLErrors[0]?.extensions?.code === 'unauthorized') {
    console.error("Bad credentials")
    return
  }

  const myOrgs = data.currentUser.roles.map(({title})=>title).join(', ')
  console.log(`I am ${data.currentUser.email}`)
  console.log(`I am member of these orgs: ${myOrgs}`)
}
```
