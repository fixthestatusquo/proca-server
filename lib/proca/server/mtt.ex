  Built-in service to send MTT emails to targets.any()

  This email sender works independently of queue-bound email supporter worker,
  because it is time-bound, sends according to schedule.

  This server runs every 30 seconds or more (under load).

  I every run, it will:

  1. Calculate `dupeRank` for the MTT messages
  2. For every campaign for which today falls into day range of sending MTT, launch `Proca.Server.MTTWorker`
  3. Send out all the test MTT's instantly
  4. Wait untill all `Proca.Server.MTTWorker` finish
